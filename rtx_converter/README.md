# Dawn of War Screen Editor
A tool for packing and unpacking RTX images.

# Download application
See the [latest release](https://github.com/amorgun/dow_utils/releases/tag/RC0.1).
Get `screen_editor.zip` from there.

# Antivirus issues
This tool uses [PyInstaller](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/tree/develop) to build exe files and some antivirus software flags it as a virus.  
You can read the detailed explanation [here](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/blob/develop/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/antivirus.md).  
You can either add the `.exe` to the exceptions or run it from the source code.
